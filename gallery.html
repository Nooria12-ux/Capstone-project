      <h2>Jamidar Bari</h2>
      <p>
        Jamidar Bari in Tangail is a historical palace built by wealthy
        landlords during the British colonial period. It is a beautiful and
        grand building with tall pillars, wide verandas, and intricate designs.
        The palace shows the rich cultural and architectural heritage of that
        time. Many visitors come to see it and learn about the history of the
        zamindars (landowners) in Bengal. My school took us to the Jamidar Bari
        last year. It was beautiful and it also had a museum beside it. We had a
        lot of fun there.

      <h2>Shonshod Bhaban</h2>
      <p>
        Shonshod Bhaban, also known as the National Parliament House, is a
        famous building in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was designed by architect Louis
        Kahn and is one of the largest legislative buildings in the world. The
        building is made of concrete and has a unique design with geometric
        shapes and large openings that let in natural light. It is surrounded by
        a beautiful lake and gardens, making it a popular spot for visitors. It
        was very big yet so beautiful. Beside the Shonshod Bhaban, there was a
        big flower garden and the place would shine due to the lighting systems.

      <h2>Padma River</h2>
      <p>
        The Padma River is one of the major rivers in Bangladesh. It is a large
        and important waterway, flowing from the Ganges River in India and
        joining with other rivers in Bangladesh. I went to see the Padma River,
        its refreshing view made me pleased. Its very big and breathtakingly
        beautiful.
